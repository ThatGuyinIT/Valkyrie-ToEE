UILore.uitext,Centuries ago, a cult of evil was purged from the world of Greyhawk. They had sought to summon something utterly vile though they were defeated. The cult was destroyed, their magic purged, the temple sealed and the memory of it all forgotten  \n\nThe ruins of that temple lie now under the Hills of Somber, lost in the immense forests that circle the small town of Hommlet, in the filthy shire of Nulb.\n\nOf late, folk from Hommlet whisper about strange sightings in the forest. They lock their door and bolt their windows when night falls.
