EventGame1Start.text,ESCAPE \n\nYou were travelling to the town of Hommlet because of the rumors—the  whispers of  fire in the sky, rumblings in the earth, voices on the wind. The locals whispered of disappearances of anyone who wandered into the countryside. You and your companions felt compelled to act. If only you’d been more prepared…\n\nWhat happened? The last thing you remember was travelling on the road, close to the forest … an ambush ... crazed maniacs wearing robes of stone, or fire. It’s all hazy now. But one thing you recall with certainty—their eyes glowed with a strange inner light.\n\nYou awaken in a damp, musty underground cell.
